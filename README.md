# File-update-Algorithm-with-Python


## Objective

Create a Python algorithm to automate the process of checking and updating an allow list of IP addresses for restricted access to sensitive patient data, ensuring that unauthorized individuals are prevented from accessing the network.


## Scenario

A healthcare company maintains a list of IP addresses authorized to access a restricted network containing sensitive patient data. To ensure security, the company needs to regularly update this allow list, removing any IP addresses that are no longer authorized. You are tasked with creating a Python script to automate this process by comparing the allow list with a remove list of IP addresses and removing any matches from the allow list. This will help prevent unauthorized access to critical information.
